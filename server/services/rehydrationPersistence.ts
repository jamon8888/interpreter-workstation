/**
 * Vault persistence for thread rehydration maps (#162).
 *
 * Two paths produce tokens for one thread: the composer redacts what the user
 * typed, and `runtimeRedaction` redacts file contents the agent reads. A
 * reveal cannot know which produced a given token, so both merge into the same
 * thread store and persist as one blob at `vaults/thread-{threadKey}.enc`.
 * `decrypt('thread-{threadKey}')` reads it back after a reload.
 *
 * Persistence never fails a send. A vault that cannot be written leaves the
 * maps in memory for the rest of the session, and the caller is told so it can
 * say as much — the failure is reported, never swallowed, and never a reason to
 * block the chat or to resend raw text.
